# Dotfiles
Personal Setup with Qtile. 

If you are here, its probably because of my unixporn post. There are some things not included in this dotfiles: 
1. rofi designs are not my own. They belong to adi1090x. You can find his repo for install at: https://github.com/adi1090x/rofi. 
For each rofi design, he repo has a folder for you to customise color, I will add the text files with what color I use for powermenu and app launcher. His repo will give you the rest of the instructions to proceed. 
2. You will need awsome font, feather icons and google material fonts installed for icons to load properly. 
3. Firefox is a fork of Bento: https://github.com/Oceanman15/Bento. This is my own fork. Read the Read.me, it will give you instructions. Please create your own fork though becuase if you use mine for your browser, any changes I do to the code will change for you too. 
4. Gtk themes: don't forget to install lxappearance.
Have fun. 

Personal to-dos: 
make icons only dependent on ttf-font-awsome from aur. 
icons that font awsome cannot cover will be replaced with qtile bar's image widget. Icons will be created through gimp and pasted onto the bar as an image that functions identically to the original/traditional font-awsome icons. such icons will be stored in .config/qtile/icons directory which you can find on this repo. 
To do this though, I will have to learn how to use Gimp which will have to wait till after exams and interviews.
